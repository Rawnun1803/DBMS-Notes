# Week 02 Summary  
Structured Query Language (SQL) and Intermediate SQL

## Overview

Week 02 focuses on Structured Query Language (SQL), covering:

- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Advanced querying
- Nested subqueries
- Joins
- Views
- Integrity constraints
- Authorization and security

This week transitions from theoretical relational model concepts to practical database implementation using SQL.

## Core Topics Covered

### 1. SQL Fundamentals
- History and standardization of SQL
- Structure of select-from-where queries
- create table and domain types
- insert, delete, update operations
- distinct and duplicate handling

### 2. Advanced Querying
- like operator and pattern matching
- order by clause
- Set operations: union, intersect, except
- Aggregate functions: avg, min, max, sum, count
- group by and grouping rules

### 3. Nested Subqueries
- Subqueries in where clause
- Subqueries in from clause
- Correlated subqueries
- some and all comparisons
- insert using select
- Conditional updates using case

### 4. Join Operations
- Inner join
- Natural join
- Left outer join
- Right outer join
- Full outer join
- Join using on and using

### 5. Views
- create view
- Virtual vs materialized views
- Conditions for updatable views
- View expansion mechanism

### 6. Integrity Constraints
- Primary key
- Foreign key
- Unique constraint
- Check constraint
- Referential integrity actions:
  - cascade
  - set null
  - set default

### 7. Transactions
- Logical unit of work
- Atomicity concept
- Importance in multi-user systems

### 8. Authorization
- Granting privileges
- Revoking privileges
- Data-level and schema-level permissions

## Most Important Exam Concepts

- Difference between primary key and unique
- Handling of null values in aggregation
- Grouping rule in SQL
- Difference between delete and drop
- Natural join pitfalls
- Referential integrity actions
- Conditions for updatable views
- Single-value vs multi-value subqueries

## Conceptual Understanding Gained

By the end of Week 02, you should clearly understand:

- How relational schemas are implemented using SQL
- How complex queries are constructed
- How data consistency is maintained
- How security and authorization are enforced
- How joins combine relations logically

Week 02 marks the shift from theory to practical relational database usage.
