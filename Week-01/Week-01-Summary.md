## 5 Interview Questions

1. Will changing storage format affect SQL queries?  
   No, due to physical data independence.

2. Can primary key contain NULL?  
   No.

3. Role of query optimizer?  
   Selects efficient execution plan.

4. Composite vs Compound key?  
   Composite: attributes not keys individually.  
   Compound: attributes are keys elsewhere.

5. Why is relational algebra not Turing complete?  
   Cannot express all recursive algorithms.
