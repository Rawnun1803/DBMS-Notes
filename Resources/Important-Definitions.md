# Important Definitions  
## NPTEL DBMS Master Definition Sheet

This document consolidates the most important DBMS definitions across concepts.  
It is designed for quick revision before exams and interviews.

## 1. Database Fundamentals

### Database
An organized collection of interrelated data.

### Database Management System (DBMS)
Software that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases.

### Enterprise Information
All data related to an organization’s operations.

### Data Redundancy
Unnecessary duplication of data in multiple locations.

### Data Inconsistency
When multiple copies of the same data do not match.

### Integrity Constraint
A rule that ensures accuracy and consistency of data.

### Atomicity
Property ensuring that a transaction is executed completely or not at all.

---

## 2. Data Abstraction and Architecture

### Physical Level
Describes how data is stored internally.

### Logical Level
Describes what data is stored and relationships among data.

### View Level
Describes only the part of the database visible to a user.

### Schema
The overall logical structure of the database.

### Instance
The actual data stored in the database at a specific time.

### Physical Data Independence
Ability to modify physical storage without affecting logical schema.

### Logical Data Independence
Ability to modify logical schema without affecting user views.

### Metadata
Data about data, stored in the data dictionary.

---

## 3. Database Languages

### DDL (Data Definition Language)
Used to define database structure.
Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)
Used to access and modify data.
Examples: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

### SQL (Structured Query Language)
Standard language used to interact with relational databases.

---

## 4. Database Internals

### Storage Manager
Component responsible for storing and retrieving data from disk.

### Query Processor
Converts SQL queries into execution plans.

### Query Optimizer
Selects the most efficient way to execute a query.

### Transaction
A sequence of operations that performs a single logical task.

### Transaction Manager
Ensures database consistency during concurrent access and failures.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Person responsible for managing database system operations, security, and backups.

---

## 5. Relational Model

### Relation
A table consisting of rows and columns.

### Attribute
A column in a relation.

### Tuple
A row in a relation.

### Domain
The set of allowed values for an attribute.

### Null Value
Represents unknown or missing data.

---

## 6. Keys

### Superkey
A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.

### Candidate Key
A minimal superkey.

### Primary Key
A candidate key selected to uniquely identify tuples.

### Alternate Key
Candidate keys not chosen as primary key.

### Composite Key
A key consisting of more than one attribute.

### Surrogate Key
Artificial key generated by the system.

### Foreign Key
An attribute that references the primary key of another relation.

---

## 7. Relational Algebra

### Relational Algebra
A formal query language based on set theory.

### Select (σ)
Returns rows that satisfy a condition.

### Project (π)
Returns specified columns and removes duplicates.

### Union
Combines tuples from two compatible relations.

### Set Difference
Returns tuples in one relation but not in another.

### Cartesian Product
Combines every tuple of one relation with every tuple of another.

### Natural Join
Combines relations based on common attributes.

### Aggregate Functions
Functions that compute a single value from multiple rows.
Examples: SUM, AVG, COUNT.
