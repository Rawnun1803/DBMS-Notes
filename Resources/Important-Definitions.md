# Important Definitions  
NPTEL DBMS Master Definition Sheet

This document consolidates essential DBMS definitions for semester exams, interviews, and revision.

## 1. Database Fundamentals

Database  
An organized collection of interrelated data.

Database Management System (DBMS)  
Software that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases.

Enterprise Information  
All data related to an organization’s operations.

Data Redundancy  
Unnecessary duplication of data.

Data Inconsistency  
Mismatch between multiple copies of the same data.

Integrity Constraint  
A rule that ensures accuracy and consistency of data.

Metadata  
Data describing the structure of the database.

---

## 2. Data Abstraction and Architecture

Physical Level  
Describes how data is stored internally.

Logical Level  
Describes what data is stored and relationships among data.

View Level  
Describes the part of the database visible to a user.

Schema  
The overall logical structure of the database.

Instance  
The actual data stored at a specific time.

Physical Data Independence  
Ability to modify physical storage without affecting logical schema.

Logical Data Independence  
Ability to modify logical schema without affecting user views.

---

## 3. Database Components

Storage Manager  
Responsible for storing and retrieving data from disk.

Query Processor  
Converts SQL queries into execution plans.

Query Optimizer  
Selects the most efficient query execution strategy.

Transaction Manager  
Ensures consistency during concurrent access and failures.

Database Administrator (DBA)  
Responsible for database security, tuning, backups, and access control.

---

## 4. Relational Model

Relation  
A table consisting of rows and columns.

Tuple  
A row in a relation.

Attribute  
A column in a relation.

Domain  
Set of allowed values for an attribute.

Null Value  
Represents unknown or missing information.

---

## 5. Keys

Super Key  
A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.

Candidate Key  
A minimal super key.

Primary Key  
A selected candidate key that uniquely identifies tuples and cannot contain null.

Alternate Key  
Candidate keys not chosen as primary key.

Composite Key  
A key consisting of more than one attribute.

Surrogate Key  
An artificial key generated by the system.

Foreign Key  
An attribute that references the primary key of another relation.

---

## 6. SQL Concepts

DDL  
Data Definition Language used to define schema.  
Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

DML  
Data Manipulation Language used to query and modify data.  
Examples: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Subquery  
A query nested inside another query.

Correlated Subquery  
A subquery that refers to attributes of the outer query.

Aggregate Function  
Functions that compute a single value from multiple rows.  
Examples: SUM, AVG, COUNT.

View  
A virtual relation defined by a query.

Materialized View  
A physically stored view.

Transaction  
A sequence of operations that performs a single logical task.

Atomicity  
Ensures a transaction executes completely or not at all.

Privilege  
Authorization to perform specific actions on database objects.

---

## 7. Integrity Constraints

Primary Key Constraint  
Ensures uniqueness and not null property.

Unique Constraint  
Ensures uniqueness but may allow null.

Check Constraint  
Ensures attribute values satisfy a condition.

Referential Integrity  
Ensures foreign key values exist in referenced primary key.

Cascade  
Automatically propagates updates or deletions to referencing tuples.

Set Null  
Sets foreign key to null on deletion.

Set Default  
Sets foreign key to default value on deletion.

---

## 8. Join Types

Natural Join  
Joins relations on attributes with the same name.

Inner Join  
Returns only matching tuples.

Left Outer Join  
Preserves all tuples from left relation.

Right Outer Join  
Preserves all tuples from right relation.

Full Outer Join  
Preserves all tuples from both relations.

---

## 9. Relational Algebra

Relational Algebra  
Formal query language based on set theory.

Select (σ)  
Filters rows based on condition.

Project (π)  
Selects specific columns and removes duplicates.

Union  
Combines tuples from two compatible relations.

Intersection  
Returns common tuples.

Set Difference  
Returns tuples in one relation but not in another.

Cartesian Product  
Combines every tuple of one relation with every tuple of another.

Natural Join  
Combines relations based on common attributes.
